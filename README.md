# AI-in-Agriculture-for-Improving-Crop-Production
Applying ML Algorithms or Methods to predict which crop is suitable for the particular soil properties.

This was my SET Conference work done in VIT.

Used ML algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Ensemble.
Random Forest produced the best accuracy results.
